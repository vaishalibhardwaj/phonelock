# Time-Based Phone Password Lock

The Time-Based Phone Password Lock project is a Python-based application that generates dynamic passwords for phone authentication based on the current time. The password changes regularly, enhancing security and convenience for users.

## Features

- Generates dynamic passwords based on the current time in Indian Standard Time (IST).
- Allows users to customize password generation functions.
- Demonstrates time-based authentication and basic Python programming concepts.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to explore and implement a time-based password lock system using Python. The project serves educational and practical purposes by showcasing:

- Time and datetime manipulation in Python.
- Customizable password generation using user-defined functions.
- Basic security concepts for dynamic password systems.

## How It Works

The project calculates a password based on the current hour and minute in Indian Standard Time (IST) using customizable functions defined by the user. The password changes every minute and can be used as a time-based authentication method for phone access.
While the project described may be simplistic in its implementation, it provides a foundation for exploring more advanced security concepts and can be adapted and extended for practical applications in various domains. The use and impact of such a project can vary depending on the context and specific requirements of the intended application.
